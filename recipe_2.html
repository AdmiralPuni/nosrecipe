                            1. Let's make the pizza dough. Add the water to the instant dry yeast and stir to mix. The yeast
                            will be mixed in the dough later so you don't need to dissolve it completely at this stage.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/1.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>2. Set a kneading blade in the food processor. Then, add the bread flour, cake flour, sugar, salt,
                            olive oil and the diluted yeast.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/2.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>3. Combine the mixture in the work bowl. This will avoid scattering the flour and lead to better
                            results in the kneading process.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/3.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>4. Cover and turn the processor to low speed. Then, gradually switch to high speed. Knead the dough
                            for about 2 minutes until the surface is smooth and glossy. The kneading time slightly varies depending
                            on the type of processor so adjust the time accordingly.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/4.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>5. Remove the dough from the work bowl. Dust a cutting board with bread flour and place the dough
                            onto it. Halve the dough with a scraper.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/5.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>6. Take the half of the dough and shape it into a ball. Then close the bottom.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/6.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>7. Next, coat the bottom of a bowl with olive oil and place the dough piece into it. Repeat the
                            process for the other half of the dough. If a larger bowl is available, you can place both dough balls
                            in the same bowl.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/7.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>8. Coat the surface of the dough with olive oil to avoid drying out.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/8.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>9. Cover each bowl with a dampened towel. Then, place a lid on the bowls. Rest the dough in a warm
                            place at approximately 35 °C (95 °F) for about 1 hour.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/9.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>10. Now, the fermentation has developed and the dough has risen. Dust the cutting board with bread
                            flour and carefully remove the dough ball.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/10.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>11. Dust the dough with bread flour. Flatten the dough with your palm but avoid pressing the edges.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/11.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>12. Then, stretch the dough from the center outward as if you are pushing away the air inside. Keep
                            stretching the dough into a large round sheet until it reaches about 20cm (7.9") across.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/12.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>13. Then, place the dough onto a sheet of round parchment paper.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/13.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>14. Let's season the sliced long green onion and maitake mushrooms. Lightly salt and pepper. Drizzle
                            on the olive oil. Toss to coat.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/14.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>15. Then, distribute the onion and mushrooms onto the dough. Alternatively, shiitake, shimeji or
                            king oyster mushrooms can be used.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/15.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>16. Next, top with the teriyaki chicken pieces. Pour over the teriyaki sauce.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/16.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>17. Arrange the sliced mozzarella cheese. You can also add your favorite type of pizza cheese to
                            taste. Sprinkle on the chopped spring onion leaves.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/17.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>18. Be sure to preheat the oven to 250 °C (480 °F) while stretching the dough. Place the pizza into
                            the oven and bake at 250 °C (480 °F) for about 4 to 5 minutes. Using an upturned baking sheet will make
                            the pizza closer to the heat source.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/18.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>19. When the melting cheese makes a sizzling sound and the dough turns golden brown, it is ready.
                            Remove the pizza with tongs.
                            <img class="image_content" src="res/images/teriyaki-chicken-pizza/19.jpg" alt="">
                            <br>20. You can place the pizza onto a clean cutting board and cut into pieces with a pizza cutter. The
                            shichimi chili powder goes great with this teriyaki chicken pizza. You can also top with sansho pepper
                            to taste.
